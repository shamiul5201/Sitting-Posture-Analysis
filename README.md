## Sitting-Posture-Analysis
The secret to a person's general well-being is proper posture. However, frequently maintain proper body posture might be challenging. The actions necessary to create a solution for that is outlined in this repository. We will discover how to build a Sitting body position detection system using MediaPipe. Samples taken from the side will be used for analysis and conclusion-making. A webcam aimed at the person's side view would be necessary for a useful use. 

## Mediapipe Pose
MediaPipe Pose is a machine learning solution for high-fidelity body pose tracking that infers 33 3D landmarks and a background segmentation mask on the entire body from RGB video frames using BlazePose research, which also drives the ML Kit Pose Detection API.
